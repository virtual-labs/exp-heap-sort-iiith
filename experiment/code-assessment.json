      "description": "Implement a simplified heap sort algorithm to sort the given input list of numbers. Build a max heap from the array, then repeatedly extract the maximum element and place it at the end to sort in ascending order. Example: [64,66,20,49,11,79,21,20,99] should become [11,20,20,21,49,64,66,79,99]. Only JavaScript is allowed.",

Build a min-heap of size k and iterate through the array, replacing the smallest element in the heap when a larger element is found, then extract all elements to get the k largest in descending order.

      "description": "Sort an array where each element is at most k positions away from its sorted position using a heap-based approach. Maintain a min-heap of size k+1 and process elements by inserting into the heap and extracting the minimum to place in the sorted position, which efficiently handles the limited disorder.
